# inspect state
git status --short --branch

# search
rg "pattern"
rg --files

# validate JSON preset files
python3 -m json.tool presets/lean-context/files/repomix.config.json >/dev/null

## Important Files

- `README.md`: repository purpose, shared standards, and preset catalog.
- `AGENTS.md`: active agent workflow rules for this repository.
- `VERSION`: authoritative version source for this repository.
- `docs/CATALOG.md`: source of truth for available and planned templates and
  presets.
- `docs/SNAPSHOTS.md`: chronological project memory.
- `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`: template and preset conventions.
- `docs/WORKFLOWS.md`: shared workflow rules.
- `presets/lean-context/`: reusable preset for lean context loading.
- `presets/lean-context/docs/RECOMMENDATION_FLOW.md`: guide for recommending a
  template and preset combination before adoption.

## Current Decisions

- Root documentation is written in concise English.
- Spanish phrases appear only as prompt examples that agents should recognize.
- Project templates will live under `templates/<project-type>/`.
- Reusable workflow layers live under `presets/<preset-name>/`.
- `lean-context` is both stored as a preset and applied to this repository.
- Agents should recommend templates and presets before copying or applying them.
- Agents must check `docs/CATALOG.md` before claiming a template can be copied.
- Pushes remain explicit; local commits and tags may be created during closed
  versioned iterations.

## Current Risks

- Concrete project templates are currently planned but not available.
- `project-context-mcp` is documented as a design guide but not implemented.
- Third-party MCP, tracking, and compression tools can change quickly and should
  be rechecked before automation is added.

## Search Notes

- Use `docs/AI_SEARCH.md` before opening broad directories.
- Prefer slices over full files.
- Do not inspect ignored or generated paths unless directly needed.
